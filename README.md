## ⚠️ Limitations
**OpenWeatherAPI (Free Version)**: 

This version of the app uses the free tier of the OpenWeatherAPI, which has some limitations:

❗Weather forecasts are available only up to 5 days in advance.

❗Hourly forecasts are provided at 3-hour intervals.

❗The app does not support displaying the minimum and maximum temperature for the current day. To improve the user experience, these values are calculated manually.

## 🔜 Future Improvements
Additional features from the original Apple Weather app will be integrated into WeatherApp in future updates.
The app is continuously being improved to provide a better and more comprehensive weather experience.
